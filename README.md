# Extra Credits Game Jam #4

This is [e-krebs](https://github.com/e-krebs) and [SwissBerf](https://github.com/SwissBerf)'s entry for [Extra Credits Game Jam #4](https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-jam-4).

The theme of the game jam is **CONNECT**.

> This is both our first-ever attempt at making a video game!

## Theme

Genre: platform-puzzle.

Our idea is to **connect** the main character with _sidekicks_.
The connection happens by proximity.
Once connected, the _sidekick_ moves following the player's controls (same as the main character).

There's 2 different sidekicks:
- a _small_ one, he can reach specific spots because of his size
- a _double-jumping_ one, he can can reach specific spots because of his _double-jump_ ability
